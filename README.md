PolarFileConverter
==================

Coverts a heart rate monitor file from a Polar device to a format that is supported by RunKeeper. At least files from older devices such as the S625X need to be converted before importing to RunKeeper in order for the time units to match.

Usage:
Launch the application and click the "Select files to convert" button, a file dialogue appears. Select the Polar xml-files that you want to convert and press ok, RunKeeper compatible .hrm files with the same names will be created in the same directory.
